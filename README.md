# IN2026 Games Technology Coursework
## Task
The main task of this coursework is to add new features to the pre-made Asteroids game.  The coursework is split into three parts, each which requires a feature to be implemented to the game. The coursework is written in C++ using Visual Studio. The Asteroids game without the following features implemented can be [found here](https://www.github.com/Skyth3r/IN2026-Asteroids-Template)

### Part 1
Part 1 requires one of the following to be implemented:
* A Start screen (Implemented)
* Asteroids that split into smaller asteroids when hit

### Part 2
Part 2 requires one of the following to be implemented:
* A high score table
* A bonus/power-up system (Implemented)

### Part 3
Part 3 requires one of the following to be implemented:
* A demo mode (Implemented)
* An alien spaceship

### Additional Features
There was also some extra things I added to make the game run the way I wanted it to. I ended up adding the following to further improve the game:
* Back to start screen - Once the ‘Game Over’ screen is shown the game will promptly switch back to the start screen so players can play the game again if they wish to
* Reverse thrust - To slow down before the played need to turn the opposite direction of which they thrust and then press up to slow down.
* Shield bonus points -  Score is increased by 50 if a shield is picked up when a shield is already active
